Hi!
I'm Laur and that's my first public project on GitHub.
Hope it's not that bad and you will enjoy it :)

The idea here is very simple and pretty common. Basically, everything this program does is moving files from a folder to another ones by their extension.
I used it in "Downloads" folder and sorted all files. Now I really enjoy the result!

How to use this script:
1)You must have python installed on your computer to run it from console(i'll add exe later)
2)Open the main.py and change the value for "old_directory" which is the dir from where we will sort our files to yours
3)Lower is a list of variables with paths for every extension you would like to add.
You have to redact them for your needs. Ex: new_directory_txt = "your/path/to/store/files/with/txt/extension"
4)Lower is a list of dictionaries which stores paths for every extension you want to use.Also redact it for your needs

*Note :You don't have to create dirs manually,just add paths to variables and program will create them.
       If there will be multiple files with the same name,the program will add to the new one the current time. Just to work corectly

If you have any questions/ideas how to improove that program, feel free to contact me on instagram @laur.rvt
